# Data Cynical
Query edit &amp; execute. From SQLite, PostgreSQL, (coming MSSQL, MySQL). Create ready-to-share reports, dashboards, or forms. 
Data Cynical has a core project to execute reports in your own 
apps. This project includes a main web UI where you can connect 
to a DB (local or online), then load in reports, make changes, 
then save them out to a JSON file. Use the app to save any query 
created in the UI to SQL or a CSV of the results.
